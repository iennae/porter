We have a few release types available for you to use:

You can also install and manage [mixins](#mixins) using porter,
and use the [Porter VS Code Extension][vscode-ext] for help
authoring bundles.

# Older Version

Install an older version of porter, starting with `v0.18.1-beta.2`. This also
installs the latest version of all the mixins. If you need a specific version of
a mixin, use the `--version` flag when [installing the mixin](#mixins).

Set `VERSION` to the version of Porter that you want to install.

# Mixins

We have a number of [mixins](/mixins) to help you get started, and stable mixins
are installed by default.

You can update an existing mixin, or install a new mixin using the `porter mixin
install` command:

```console
$ porter mixin install terraform
installed terraform mixin v0.3.0-beta.1 (0d24b85)
```

All of the Porter-authored mixins are published to `https://cdn.porter.sh/mixins/atom.xml`.

# Plugins

We are working on building out [plugins](/plugins) to extend Porter and the stable
plugins are installed by default.

You can update an existing plugin, or install a new plugin using the `porter plugin
install` command:

```console
$ porter plugin install azure --version canary
installed azure plugin v0.1.1-10-g7071451 (7071451)
```

All of the Porter-authored plugins are published to `https://cdn.porter.sh/plugins/atom.xml`.
